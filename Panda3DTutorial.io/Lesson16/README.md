Lesson 16 (C++ Addendum)
------------------------

Panda3D has no additional installation support for C++ that I know of,
at least as of 1.10.13.  You can, of course, use the Python ecosystem
to install binaries as well, but I will not be providing instructions
here.  One of the reasons I don't like Python is its ecosystem, partly
encouraged by complete lack of API stability:  install a whole
mini-distribution just to use a single program.  So much for
"batteries included": they're all just like proprietary phone
batteries:  a different, incompatible one every few months.

Maybe if I think of something Panda3D-specific to add here, I will,
but until then, you're on your own.  Sorry.  Use Python if that
bothers you.
