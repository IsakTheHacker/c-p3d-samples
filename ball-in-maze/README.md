>This tutorial shows how to detect and respond to collisions. It uses solids
>create in code and the egg files, how to set up collision masks, a traverser,
>and a handler, how to detect collisions, and how to dispatch function based
>on the collisions. All of this is put together to simulate a labyrinth-style
>game
